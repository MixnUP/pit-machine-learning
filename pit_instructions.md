PIT: Machine Learning Project Proposal and Implementation
 October 13-16, 2025
Form a group of.
Choose your members wisely, considering a mix of skills in programming, data analysis, research, and documentation.
Designate a  who will be the main point of contact.
Submit your group composition with full names.
Your task is to propose, design, and implement a machine learning project that addresses a specific problem, opportunity, or question relevant to the Philippines. The project must utilize a dataset that is either:
 from a Philippine source (e.g., government agency, local research institution, Filipino creator on Kaggle), or
 by your group (e.g., through surveys, web scraping of Philippine websites, collecting images of local scenes).
The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the ability to apply ML techniques to solve real-world problems in your local environment.
Your group must submit a formal project proposal. The proposal should be a concise document (2-3 pages) containing the following sections:
A clear and descriptive title (e.g., "A Random Forest Model for Predicting Dengue Outbreaks in Metro Manila using Climate Data").
Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve or the question you are trying to answer.
Explain why this problem is relevant and significant in the Philippine setting.
 Identify the type (e.g., Classification, Regression, Clustering, Computer Vision, NLP).
 Propose at least one specific algorithm you plan to use (e.g., ). Justify your choice.
 Briefly outline your planned steps:
Data Acquisition & Collection
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Feature Engineering/Selection
Model Selection & Training
Model Evaluation (mention specific metrics, e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE)
Interpretation of Results
 Provide the exact URL or describe how you will gather your own data.
 Explicitly state and prove the Philippine origin of the data.
 Describe the features (columns) and the target variable.
 State the number of samples and features you expect to work with.
What is the intended output of your model? (e.g., a predictive tool, a classification system, a trend analysis).
How could the results be potentially used by a stakeholder in the Philippines?
List each member and their primary responsibility (e.g., Data Preprocessing, Model Development, Documentation, Presentation).
