# PIT: Machine Learning Project Proposal and Implementation
**October 13-16, 2025**

## Group Formation

Form a group of 3-5 members with a mix of skills in:

* Programming
* Data Analysis
* Research
* Documentation

Designate a **team leader** who will be the main point of contact.

Submit your group composition with full names.

## Project Overview

Your task is to propose, design, and implement a machine learning project that addresses a specific problem, opportunity, or question relevant to the Philippines.

### Data Requirements

The project must utilize a dataset that is either:

1. From a Philippine source (e.g., government agency, local research institution, Filipino creator on Kaggle), or
2. Collected by your group (e.g., through surveys, web scraping of Philippine websites, collecting images of local scenes)

**Goal:** Demonstrate the ability to apply ML techniques to solve real-world problems in your local environment.

## Project Proposal (2-3 pages)

### 1. Title

A clear and descriptive title (e.g., "A Random Forest Model for Predicting Dengue Outbreaks in Metro Manila using Climate Data")

### 2. Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve or the question you are trying to answer.

Explain why this problem is relevant and significant in the Philippine setting.

### 3. Methodology

#### Machine Learning Approach

* Identify the type (e.g., Classification, Regression, Clustering, Computer Vision, NLP)
* Propose at least one specific algorithm you plan to use and justify your choice

#### Implementation Plan

1. Data Acquisition & Collection
2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering/Selection
4. Model Selection & Training
5. Model Evaluation (mention specific metrics, e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE)
6. Interpretation of Results

### 4. Data Description

#### Source

* Provide the exact URL or describe how you will gather your own data
* Explicitly state and prove the Philippine origin of the data

#### Dataset Details

* Describe the features (columns) and the target variable
* State the number of samples and features you expect to work with

### 5. Expected Output and Impact

* What is the intended output of your model? (e.g., a predictive tool, a classification system, a trend analysis)
* How could the results be potentially used by a stakeholder in the Philippines?

### 6. Team Members and Responsibilities

List each member and their primary responsibility:

* [Name] - [responsibility] (e.g., Data Preprocessing, Model Development, Documentation, Presentation)
