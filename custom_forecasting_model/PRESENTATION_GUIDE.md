- Model's predictive capabilities
- Comparison with baseline models (if available)

## Slide 5: Recommendation
- **For Policy Makers:**
  - Infrastructure planning based on forecasted demand
  - Energy policy considerations
- **Future Work:**
  - Incorporate additional features (GDP, population growth, etc.)
  - Try more complex models
  - Expand to regional-level forecasting
- **Final Thoughts:**
  - Summary of key takeaways
  - Potential impact of the model
  - Call to action

## Presentation Tips
1. **Visuals:**
   - Use the generated `custom_forecast_plot.png` in /output folder
   - Include relevant charts and graphs
   - Use consistent color scheme

2. **Talking Points:**
   - Emphasize the custom implementation aspect
   - Highlight the practical applications
   - Be prepared to discuss model limitations

3. **Timing:**
   - Allocate ~2 minutes per slide
   - Leave time for Q&A
   - Practice transitions between slides
